title="The continuous reactive tabu search: Blending combinatorial optimization and stochastic search for global optimization",
journal="Annals of Operations Research",
year="1996",
volume="63",
number="2",
pages="151--188",
abstract="A novel algorithm for the global optimization of functions (C-RTS) is presented, in which a combinatorial optimization method cooperates with a stochastic local minimizer. The combinatorial optimization component, based on the Reactive Tabu Search recently proposed by the authors, locates the most promising ``boxes'', in which starting points for the local minimizer are generated. In order to cover a wide spectrum of possible applications without user intervention, the method is designed with adaptive mechanisms: the box size is adapted to the local structure of the function to be optimized, the search parameters are adapted to obtain a proper balance of diversification and intensification. The algorithm is compared with some existing algorithms, and the experimental results are presented for a variety of benchmark tasks.",
